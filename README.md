# Combining DNA sequences and chaotic maps to improve robustness of RGB image encryption

by Onkar Thorat and Ramchandra Mangrulkar

Abstract - In todayâ€™s world colour images are vastly generated and stored for a variety of purposes by organisations. Standard encryption schemes such as AES or DES are not well suited for encryption of multimedia data due to their pattern appearance and high computational cost. Many methods are being proposed for the encryption of greyscale images. However, there are only a few methods proposed in the literature specifically for encrypting the colour images. This paper presents a new method called RGB image encryption scheme (RGBIES) for encrypting the colour images based on chaotic maps and DNA sequences. RGBIES has three major stages. Stages 1 and 3 propose a powerful scrambling algorithm based on a chaotic logistic map. The intermediate step uses a chaotic Lorenz map, the keys of which are obtained using DNA sequences. Various visual and quantitative analyses are performed that prove the resistance of the method against modern-day attacks.
